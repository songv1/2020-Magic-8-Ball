# Magic 8 Ball

## Description
A program emulating the eponymous novelty toy. A random number is generated after the program takes in a user input. The random number is associated with a specific Magic 8 Ball answer. 

## Motivation
This project was created as part of my learning of the C++ programming language. Specifically, I wanted to write a program that incorporated the switch statement.
